                            As a result the last couple of eps haven’t been super exciting for me, because they’ve
                            been more like settling into a familiar and comfortable routine.  We’re seeing character
                            growth here but it’s subtle (apart from Shouyou, arguably).  I mean, Tobio being an
                            asshole is nothing new – it’s kind of the foundation of his entire character arc. 
                            Confronting whether his being an asshole is a problem for the Crows this directly is a
                            bit of an evolution, and probably an overdue one at that, but the overall dynamic with
                            Kageyama is basically unchanged.

                            In Japan the idea of a first-year speaking to a senior the way Kageyama did to Asahi is a
                            lot more shocking than it would be in the West, but Tobio calling out teammates in
                            genuinely rude fashion in the middle of a match is what got him isolated in the first
                            place.  It’s better for the Crows to sort this out in practice matches than the real
                            deal, but this is really on Tobio – he has to figure out how to co-exist with others in
                            a team environment.
